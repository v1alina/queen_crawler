# queen_crawler
This is a web crawler for downloading Queen Elizabeth II's Christmas broadcasts. I created this for a group project, in which we need to collect our own corpus.
With the crawler you can download all the HTML files of the broadcast transcript pages and it also let's you create a corpus folder in which you can save the raw text as .txt files.
